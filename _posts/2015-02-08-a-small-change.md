I made a small change in the gh-pages branch, add google analytics script.

The main <p>JS</p> script was in the <p>_include</p> folder, and  this JS file was included in <p>head.html</p>.

In <p>_config.yml</p> file, I add the Google analytics key.

To fork the version with google analytics, please try this command:

<code>git clone --branch gh-pages https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21.git</code>

### Attention: Only gh-pages branch has google analytics and this article.
